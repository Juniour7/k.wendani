                    <p>The story of the Adventist Youth Society, now titled Young Adults (YA), began over 125 years ago along a dusty country lane in Michigan with two young boys kneeling in prayer. Today that dusty lane has become a worldwide web of highways that links over 10 million Seventh-day Adventist young people in nearly every political entity on every continent of the globe. This story comes in every hue of the rainbow; it is filled with extremes of exhilaration and mountaintop experiences, as well as deep sadness and unfulfilled dreams. This is the story of Godâ€™s leading a fascinating army down through the battles of the great overarching conflict that is life as we know it now.</p>
                    <p>AY MISSION: To lead young people into a saving relationship with Jesus Christ and help them embrace His call to discipleship. AY AIM: The Advent message to all the world in my generation. AY MOTTO: The love of Christ compels me.</p>
